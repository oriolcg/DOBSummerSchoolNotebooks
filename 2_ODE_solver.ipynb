Define a simple solver to approximate solutions of ODEs based on Taylor Series\n2. Quantify the numerical error of an approximated solution\n\n# Introduction\n\nLet's assume that we want to find an analytical expression of a function that describes the displacement an object in time $u(t)$. We also assume that the object satisfies the equation of motion given by a linear mass-damping-stiffness system:\n\n$$ m\\ddot{u}(t)+c\\dot{u}(t)+ku(t)=F(t), $$\n\nwith \n- $m$ the mass of the object, \n- $c$ the damping and $k$ the stiffness\n- $F(t)$ is a time-dependent forcing term. \n\nWe also provide appropriate initial conditions, in that case \n$$ u(0)=0,\\quad\\dot{u}(0)=\\dot{u}_0. $$\n\nIn General it is difficult to find an analytical expression that is defined at all times, $u(t)\\, âˆ€ t\\in[0,\\infty)$.\n\n![](\"https://github.com/oriolcg/ComputationalDynamics/blob/master/assets/lecture_notes/Module1/Introduction/figures/1_1.png)\n\n\n@@row\n@@img-small\n@@left ![](/assets/lecture_notes/Module1/Introduction/figures/1_1.png) @@\n@@\n~~~\n<div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n~~~\n@@\nInstead, we might be interested in knowing the value of the function at specific points in time, $u(t_0),u(t_1),u(t_2),...,u(t_N)$, see green dots in the previous figure. From these set of values, one can reconstruct an approximated function $\\tilde{u}_N(t)$ by, for instance, using a linear interpolation between points (blue dashed line in the figure).\n\nFor smooth enough functions, $u(t)$, as we increase the number of evaluation points in time, $N$, the approximated solution solution $\\tilde{u}_N(t)$ will be closer to $u(t)$.\n\n@@important \nIn this course we will learn how to find approximate solutions like $\\tilde{u}_N(t)$ by using numerical methods. \n@@\n\n\n## Notation\nIn these notes we will use the following notation: \n* $u_i:=u(t_i)$, the function evaluated at time $t_i$. \n* $\\Delta t_i:=t_i-t_{i-1}$, the time step between two consecutive time steps, $t_{i-1}$ and $t_i$.\nWhen considering constant time steps, in an interval of time $t\\in[0,T]$ with $N$ time steps, the time step size will be $\\Delta t=T/N$.\n## Why do we need an ",
