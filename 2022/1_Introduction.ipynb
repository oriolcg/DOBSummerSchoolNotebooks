During these two days you will learn **how to use numerical tools to analize the behavior of offshore structures**\n\n## Course Description\n\nThis course follows a project-based learning approach with a combination of theory and practice sessions with hands-on exercises. You can expect a highly interactive environment, and remember, the most important thing is that **you learn**, so **do not hesitate to ask questions!**\n\nThe topics that will be covered during the lectures are:\n- How Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) solvers work\n- Understanding the different structural elements and how to model them\n- Discretization of 1D structural models\n- Modeling loading on structure, focusing on spectral loads like waves\n- System with frequency-dependent parameters (added mass and damping)\n\nDuring the practicals you will work on the assignments in **small groups of 3 persons**. There will be an assignment to put the theory explained during the lecture into practice by applying it to solve a dynamical problem.\n\nOverall, this course will strengthen your understanding of dynamics, improve your programming skills and will give you a good understanding of the basics of the numerical aspects of related to solving dynamics system numerically. This knowledge will help you greatly in forthcoming phases of your career.\n\n## Learning Objectives    \n\nAt the end of this course you will be able to:\n\n- LO1: Construct a model that represents an offshore engineering application, limited to models that can be constructed from a combination of: point masses, rigid bodies, rods, Euler-Bernoulli beams.\n- LO2: Derive the equations of motion of the model, subject to typical offshore loads such as: wind, waves and currents.\n- LO3: Define different numerical methods for ODEs and PDEs, restricted to Finite Differences.\n- LO4: Implement the numerical methods and solve the problem using Python.\n- LO5: Analyse the results by: validating against analytical solutions, identifying the range of applicability of a given method, evaluating errors and assessing the convergence of the solution.\n\n## Planning\n\n| Day 1 (Thursday 01/09/2022  9:00 - 12:00, room E in Echo)||||\n| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n| Start | End | Topic | Material |\n| 9:00 | 9:15 | Introduction | [1_Introduction.ipynb](https://github.com/oriolcg/DOBSummerSchoolNotebooks/blob/main/1_Introduction.ipynb) |\n| 9:15 | 10:00 | Basic theory on ODE solvers | [2_ODE_solver.ipynb](https://github.com/oriolcg/DOBSummerSchoolNotebooks/blob/main/2_ODE_solver.ipynb) |\n| 10:00 | 10:30 | Tutorial 1: build your own ODE solver | [3_Tutorial1.ipynb](https://github.com/oriolcg/DOBSummerSchoolNotebooks/blob/main/3_Tutorial1.ipynb) |\n| 10:30 | 10:45 | Break ||\n| 10:45 | 11:45 | Exercise: Floating barge subject to irregular waves | [4_Exercise1.ipynb](https://github.com/oriolcg/DOBSummerSchoolNotebooks/blob/main/4_Exercise1.ipynb) |\n\n| Day 2 (Friday 02/09/2022  9:00 - 17:00, room E in Echo)||||\n| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n| Start | End | Topic | Material |\n| 8:45 | 9:00 | Recap on ODE solvers | [4_Exercise1_solution.ipynb](https://github.com/oriolcg/DOBSummerSchoolNotebooks/blob/main/Solutions/4_Exercise1_solution.ipynb) |\n| 9:00 | 10:00 | Basic theory about Finite Differences ||\n| 10:00 | 10:30 | Tutorial 2: build your own PDE solver (1/2) | [5_Tutorial2.ipynb](https://github.com/oriolcg/DOBSummerSchoolNotebooks/blob/main/5_Tutorial2.ipynb) |\n| 10:30 | 10:45 | Break ||\n| 10:45 | 12:00 | Tutorial 2: build your own PDE solver (2/2) | [5_Tutorial2.ipynb](https://github.com/oriolcg/DOBSummerSchoolNotebooks/blob/main/5_Tutorial2.ipynb) |\n| 12:00 | 13:00 | Lunch ||\n| 13:00 | 14:00 | Tutorial 3: irregular wave generator | [6_Tutorial3.ipynb](https://github.com/oriolcg/DOBSummerSchoolNotebooks/blob/main/6_Tutorial3.ipynb) |\n| 14:00 | 16:00 | Group project | [Project.ipynb](https://github.com/oriolcg/DOBSummerSchoolNotebooks/blob/main/Project.ipynb) |\n\n| Day 3 (Monday 05/09/2022  13:30 - 17:30, room KG02.110 in CiTG)||||\n| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n| Start | End | Topic | Material |\n| 13:30 | 15:00 | Group project | [Project.ipynb](https://github.com/oriolcg/DOBSummerSchoolNotebooks/blob/main/Project.ipynb) |\n| 15:00 | 15:15 | Break ||\n| 15:15 | 16:30 | Group project | [Project.ipynb](https://github.com/oriolcg/DOBSummerSchoolNotebooks/blob/main/Project.ipynb) |\n| 16:30 | 17:30 | Project presentations ||\n\n## Assessment\n\nYou will be assessed via a final report on the assignment completed by each group.\n\n## Who am I?\n\nI am Oriol Colomés, assistant professor at the Offshore Engineering section of the Hydraulic Engineering department (TU Delft). I am mostly interested on numerical methods for offshore engineering applications, with focus on fluid-structure interaction problems. Some more specific research interest are:\n- Hydroelasticity in floating large structures\n- Free-surface flows interacting with structures\n- Fluid-structure interaction of structures with complex geometries\n- Large scale simulations of fluid-structure interaction problems\n- Wave load mitigation in offshroe structures\n- Vortex-induced vibrations\nYou can find more details in my website: www.oriolcolomes.com\n\n## Getting started\n\nHere are some useful links where you can find Python and Jupyter notebooks tutorials:\n- https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/\n- https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/retro/notebooks/?path=notebooks/Intro.ipynb\n\nYou will find all the material for this course in the following repository:  https://github.com/oriolcg/DOBSummerSchoolNotebooks\n","metadata":{"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
