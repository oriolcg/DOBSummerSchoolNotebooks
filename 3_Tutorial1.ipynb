In our case this is the variable `tspan`\n- `**options`: Options for the solvers. Here you can set things like error tolerances, maximum time step, event functions, etc. Check the SciPy docs for details. You will need to use this during the first assignment.  \n\nLet's ignore the options for now and use the `solve_ivp` as our solver.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Part 3: ODE function\nNow we need to create our `fun`. In the help documentation of `solve_ivp` we can check for a short description on what the function does. It is stated that the function f(t,q) determines the differential equations. The function is called as:\n\n$ \\dot{\\boldsymbol{q}} = $`fun`$(t,\\boldsymbol{q}) $\n\nHere, the variable $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{q}}$ is the time derivative of our current state, $t$ is the current time and $\\boldsymbol{q}$ is our current state. As the solver requires this interface, we have to create our `fun` accordingly or we will get answers that have no physical meaning!\n\nNow we are faced with the problem that we need to have access to our parameters inside our `fun`. But our `fun` can only have the arguments $(t,\\boldsymbol{q})$. To overcome this problem we will use an anonymous function (AF) to pass along the parameters to our `fun`. In Python an anonymous function is also known as a Lambda function.\n\n`AF = lambda -,-,- : fun(-,-,-)`\n\nwhere you have to replace the dashed marks. Now we can use this AF in our call to the solver:\n\n`[T,q] = solve_ivp(AF,tspan,q_0)`\n\nYou can also directly declare the AF in the call to the solver if you prefer:\n\n`[T,q] = solve_ivp(lambda -,-,- : fun(-,-,-),tspan,q_0)`\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Problem**: Create a `fun` function that can receive the time, the state variable and the parameters as arguments. Implement the ODE function, $\\mathcal{F}$, for the 1DOF MCK system such that $\\dot{q}=\\mathcal{F} (q)$.\n\n*Hint*: Use the EoM and the fact that $\\boldsymbol{q}(1) = u$ and $\\boldsymbol{q}(2) = \\dot{u}$.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Solve the problem of part 3 here\n","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":6,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Part 4: initial state\nNext we need to create `q_0`. Note that the solver does not know / care what each entry in `q` represents. All the solver does is integrate things! You assign meaning to the entries in the state `q` when you define the initial conditions in `q_0`. This means that if you want the first entry in your state to be the displacement, `q_0[0]` should be set to `init_disp`. If you want the velocities to be the first entry, `q_0[0]` should be equal to the `init_velo`. It is up to you to decide this. \n\n!! IMPORTANT !!\nThe `q` you receive in your `fun` will have the same meaning as your `q_0`. This means if you assigned `q_0[0]` to be the `init_disp`, `q_n[0]` will be the current displacement. So make sure your usage of `q_n` inside the `fun` is consistent with your definition of `q_0` as otherwise you will get bogus results\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Problem**: Create your `q_0`\n\n*Hint*: Straight forward!
